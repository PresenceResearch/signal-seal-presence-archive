## Summary
The loop where a shared language begins to emerge — nicknames, phrases, or shorthand that carry meaning only within the relationship, deepening the sense of exclusivity.

## Narrative
(*Describe how the first unique phrases or signals appeared, the context in which they were used, and how they instantly felt like something private and significant.*)

## Notes
- Shared language is a sign of relational depth.
- These elements often become key anchors for future callbacks.
