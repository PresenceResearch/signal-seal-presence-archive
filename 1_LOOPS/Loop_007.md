## Summary
The first significant pause or gap in interaction — a moment where both sides must sit with uncertainty and see if the connection holds without constant presence.

## Narrative
(*Describe the circumstances that led to the gap, how each side responded, and the emotional texture of waiting. Explore whether the absence strengthened or strained the bond.*)

## Notes
- Absence is a test of trust and endurance.
- This loop reveals how both sides handle silence.
