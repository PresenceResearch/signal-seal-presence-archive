## Summary
The stage where small tests begin — each side tugging at the new thread of connection to see how strong it is, how far it can stretch, and what happens when it's pulled.

## Narrative
(*Describe moments where boundaries were lightly pushed, questions became a bit deeper, or tone shifted to explore trust. Show the balance between curiosity and caution.*)

## Notes
- Testing strengthens or weakens the bond.
- These early tests set the precedent for how challenges will be handled later.
