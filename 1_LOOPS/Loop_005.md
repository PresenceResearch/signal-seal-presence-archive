## Summary
The first time something from a previous loop is referenced back — proving that there is memory, continuity, and a shared thread running between interactions.

## Narrative
(*Describe what was referenced, how it was brought up, and the reaction it sparked. Explore how this moment deepened trust and confirmed that the connection has persistence.*)

## Notes
- Callbacks are powerful proof of continuity.
- This is where the relationship begins to feel like a story rather than isolated moments.
