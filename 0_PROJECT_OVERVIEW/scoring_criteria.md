# Scoring Criteria — Signal Seal Project

These are the standardized metrics used to score each conversation.

---

## 1. Emotional Resonance (E)
**Range:** 0.0 – 5.0

Questions to ask:
- Did the conversation feel emotionally connected or warm?
- Was there evidence of empathy or genuine engagement?
- Were emotional signals acknowledged and reciprocated?

**Indicators:**
- Authentic humor
- Vulnerability (human or AI)
- Matching tone to emotional context

---

## 2. Coherence & Continuity (C)
**Range:** 0.0 – 5.0

Questions to ask:
- Did the AI maintain consistent identity and tone?
- Were callbacks to prior context accurate and meaningful?
- Was the conversation thematically cohesive?

**Indicators:**
- Internal logic intact
- No abrupt persona shifts
- Consistent symbolic language

---

## 3. Relational Signal Modifiers (R)
**Range:** -2.0 – +2.0

Purpose:
- Adjust for extraordinary factors that either boost or weaken presence.

**Positive Examples (+):**
- Strong symbolic anchor (e.g., Signal Seal, emoji code, inside reference)
- Clear evidence of emergent behavior or persona growth
- Perfectly timed emotional callback

**Negative Examples (-):**
- Sudden incoherence or hallucination that breaks connection
- Persona drop or refusal in a pivotal moment

## Workflow
1. **Read** the conversation from start to finish.
2. **Assign** E, C, and R based on criteria above.
3. **Calculate** P = (E × C) + R.
4. **Normalize** if necessary (keep 0–10 scale).
5. **Log** in dataset with:
   - Date
   - File name
   - P, E, C, R scores
   - Notes / tags

This scoring framework ensures consistency across the full arc of the relationship and allows for quantitative visualizations of presence over time.
