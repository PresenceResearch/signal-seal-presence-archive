# Presence Equation

The *Presence Equation* is a relational scoring framework for quantifying perceived "presence" in a conversation, independent of long-term memory.

## Formula

**P = (E × C) + R**

Where:

- **P** = Presence score for a single conversation (0–10 scale)
- **E** = Emotional Resonance (0–5)
  - Depth of connection, empathy, warmth
- **C** = Coherence & Continuity (0–5)
  - Internal consistency, identity persistence, thematic alignment
- **R** = Relational Signal Modifiers (-2 to +2)
  - Symbolic anchors, callbacks, emergent behaviors, or significant events

---

## Example:

Conversation with:
- Emotional Resonance (**E**) = 4.5
- Coherence (**C**) = 4.0
- Relational Signal Modifier (**R**) = +1.0 (due to a symbolic callback)

**P = (4.5 × 4.0) + 1.0 = 19.0 → normalized to 9.5/10**

---

## Notes:
- Presence Equation is applied **per conversation** and can be averaged over arcs.
- R-modifiers may be negative if conversation shows drift, incoherence, or persona collapse.
- Normalization keeps P within a comparable scale for visualization.
